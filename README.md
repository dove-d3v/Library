# Library Management System

## Overview

This Library Management System is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage books in a library, issue books to students, and handle book returns. The system is structured using classes to represent books, students, and the library itself.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library with title, author, and number of copies.
- **Display Books**: View all available books along with their details.
- **Issue Books**: Issue a book to a student if copies are available.
- **Return Books**: Return an issued book back to the library.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The project is structured into a client (student) and server (management staff) architecture.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
